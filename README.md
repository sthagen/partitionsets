# Partition Sets

Consolidation of existing third party recipes for partitioning of sets and multisets/bags.

Partition Sets provides a consolidated set of recipes gently provided by other
users over the years and under the MIT license. I modified these slightly so
that they now equally work under python2 and python3. All bugs are mine ;-)

You may find it useful for tasks involving small sets and also multi sets/bags.

Third party dependencies are documented in the folder [third-party](docs/third-party/README.md).
