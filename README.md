Consolidation of existing third party recipes for partitioning of sets and multisets/bags.

## Status

Experimental

## What is in it

A small, maybe growing collection of parsers and filters
to ease dealing with specific information structures that
drop off of REST backends ;-)

## What is not yet in it

just sayin':
* proxy tools like digitally signed high water mark
* storage via lzma compression
* GDPR conforming mappings
* GDPR conforming caching
* work log analysis
* process mining support
* flattening of deeply nested records
* refactoring the elderly pypi / packaging boilerplate
* explore github actions vs. travis et al.
* make user defined fields accessible per configuration
* provide time tracking views from work log entries

**Note**: The default branch is `default`.
