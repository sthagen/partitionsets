# Partition Sets

Consolidation of existing third party recipes for partitioning of sets and multisets/bags.

Partition Sets provides a consolidated set of recipes gently provided by other
users over the years and under the MIT license. I modified these slightly so
that they now equally work under python2 and python3. All bugs are mine ;-)

You may find it useful for tasks involving small sets and also multi sets/bags.

Third party dependencies are documented in the folder [third-party](third-party/README.md).

## Primary Source repository

The primary source of `partitionsets` lives somewhere on a mountain in Central Switzerland.
But, we use decentralized version control (git), so any clone can become the source to everyone's benefit, no central only code.
Anyway, the preferred public clones of `partitionsets` are:

* [on codeberg](https://codeberg.org/sthagen/partitionsets) - a democratic community-driven, non-profit software development platform operated by Codeberg e.V.
* [at sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~sthagen/partitionsets) - a collection of tools useful for software development.

## Status

Production/stable.

**Note**: The default branch is `default`.
