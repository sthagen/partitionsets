    """ Sets of only a few items already have many ways they can be partitioned
    into subsets. Therefore it can be useful to generate these partitions by
    index, like the partition class were some large list where one can just
    access element "i". Of course one should not compute the whole list in
    advance but compute the partitions on the fly. This recipe was originally
    extracted form a book by Kreher and Stinson. Over the years I came back to
    my code from time to time creating a new and hopefully more pythonic
    version each time I understood it better. My current take on it is that the
    algorithm looks a lot like creating a Pascals triangle in order to compute
    combinations. One just tries to find a way down the triangle to a specific
    element, each time subtracting the amounts the different positions in the
    triangle account for. It is also similar to finding indexed permutations of
    a set with elements occurring more than once. One of these days I will
    perhaps understand how all of this fits together. Until then I'll post code
    solving specific situations. cf. [PartImplPy]"""

        number of ways to add i new items to a partition that already has
        j blocks. So e.g. D[1, j] = j+1 because a new
